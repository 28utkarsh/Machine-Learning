# Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains basic Machine Learning algorithms solely based on my understanding. I have not used any Machine Learning library to implement the logic except dataset loading, dataset division, and plotting visuals. This repository include the following algorithms:

1. Artificial Neural Network
2. Pearson Correlation Coefficient Calculation
3. Simple Linear Regression
4. Polynomial Regression
5. Multiple Linear Regression
6. Feature Scaling using Normalization
7. Category Generation for columns

### Execution

All these code were written as modules, so the user has to write its own dataset loading part and simply execute the file with python3 interpreter. For example,

```bash
# Run ANN
python3 ANN.py

# Run Polynomial Regression
python3 polyx.py
```

### TODO

1. Add examples to load dataset


### References

1. I have used datasets from [Machine Learning Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/) at Udemy.
